<ins>**Genetics System**</ins>
- New genetics system
- Every animal has several genetic modifiers completely unique to them
- Current genetics are health, fertility, metabolism, productivity and meat quality
- Genetics impact several different areas of the animal, such as pregnancy and sale value

<ins>**Weight System**</ins>
- New weight system
- Every animal has a weight unique to them, and each day they will gravitate to/from their ideal weight (based on their metabolism) due to how much they eat and drink

- Every supported country in the world now has several unique farms, which each produce up to 3 types of animals
- Each farm will send some of their animals to the animal dealer every day
